## Overview 
This application allows you as the user to create a resume in minutes and then download it to make yourself stand out in today's job market. A few of the technologies we used were React.js (for the front end of the app), Typeform API (to embed questionnaires to get insightful user responses to generate the resume), Auth0 (for user authentication), Microsoft Power Automate (for resume generation).


### What was our motivation?
The current job market is declining with many people in the tech industry being laid off. This sort of recession puts pressure on people, like ourselves, being recent college graduates and wanting to apply to jobs. However, we are unsure what the future may hold for ourselves and others.

### Who is our intended audience?

Our audience are college students and recent graduates from any school/institution because we can resonate with their experiences. We wanted to build an app that would be user-friendly and efficient when creating a summary of who you are into one page, or at times two.

### What problem does it solve?
This app solves the issue with people not knowing where to start when wanting to sit down and create a resume for themselves. Generally, students scour the internet for the best advice to help with their resumes. However, why not automate this with a little bit of typing and a few clicks.

### What did we learn?
This project has not only taught us about the issues of employment and resumes, but also the intricacies of building an app with this sort of scale or vision. From a technical standpoint, we have become more comfortable with troubleshooting any bugs or errors, front end back end development with React.js, Auth0’s user authentication, working with different APIs and plugins to personalize your project to goals, and learning to especially take breaks and rest when needed!

### What makes our project stand out?
Résumer differs from its competitors because it gives the user the best experience when building their resume. Instead of starting you off with a blank or prefilled template, Résumer learns who you are and tailors your resume to you based on your experiences and skills. This leaves room for you as the user to highlight things about yourself.
